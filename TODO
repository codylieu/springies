Moving mass extends fixed mass

Muscle extends Springs

Abstract Force class

Walls Class

When gravity is called a second time, the forces compound on each other, make a separate class for Gravity

Keep some separation between Parser and Springies. Remove dependencies on Parser and game

Don't instantiate objects directly in the parser, use a different way to implement it

Have variables held in the class

Have it so that setForce calculates force for the sum of all forces

Assembly should be a class yeeeee

No public instance variables

If statements should be wrapped in brackets and so should loops
